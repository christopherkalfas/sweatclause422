        About Us
    </h5>

    <p>
        At SweatClause, we care about a few things: Staying connected, holding others accountable, maintaining health, and, most importantly, GIVING BACK! 
    </p>

    <h5>What is SweatClause?</h5>

    <p>
    If you are anything like us, you probably haven't donated to charity as much as you'd like to.  Also, you've probably have wasted money on a gym membership you don't get to as much as you would like to. 
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are like us, we have a solution that we guarantee will fix one of those things.

    We are also simple people - so we keep our concept simple. 
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Get in shape or donate!</strong></h3>

    <h5>Your group, your rules:</h5>
    <p>
    Invite your friends to join a group and create a Challenge. You pick the physical activity, set a goal number, and select a charity that the loser will donate to.
    </p>

    <p>
    Are you getting back in shape? Set your weekly target as 5 push-ups. Ultra-marathoner?  Set your goal as... I don't know; I lack context on this one.
    </p>

    <p>Are you established in your career? Set your weekly "needs improvement" donation at $100. Are you starting a charity website with cash flow problems? Let's stick with $5.</p>

        Donate by neglecting our app, and we'll give your money to charity. You'll stay a lazy lump, but at you'll least make the world a better place.
